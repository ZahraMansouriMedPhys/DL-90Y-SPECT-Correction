# DL-based Attenuation and Scatter Correction for 90Y SPECT Imaging

This repository provides deep learning models developed for **CT-free attenuation correction (AC)**, **Monte Carlo-based scatter correction (SC)**, and **combined attenuation and scatter correction (ASC)** in **90Y bremsstrahlung SPECT imaging**, using a Swin UNETR architecture. These models were trained on dose maps to improve **voxel-wise and organ-level dosimetry** for patients undergoing radioembolization (RE) or Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT).

## 🧪 Background

**90Y-SPECT** is widely used for post-therapy verification in liver cancer patients treated with radioembolization. However, its quantitative accuracy is compromised by photon attenuation and scatter, especially in CT-less settings. Traditional Monte Carlo methods are accurate but slow and hardware-dependent.

This work introduces fast and robust deep learning-based alternatives using dose-domain training on a relatively large patient dataset (n=190), leveraging a Swin UNETR model with transformer-based encoding.
